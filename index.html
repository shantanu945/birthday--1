    <p> Happy Birthday, my Bebo! ❤

      Every day with you is a gift, but today is extra special because it’s the day the world was blessed with someone as incredible as you. You are the most beautiful person inside and out, and I feel so lucky to have you in my life. Your kindness, laughter, and love bring me so much happiness, and I can't imagine my days without you.
      
      From the moment you walked into my life, everything became brighter. You have a way of making even the simplest moments magical, and I cherish every single one of them. Whether we’re laughing together, sharing our dreams, or just enjoying each other’s company in silence, every second with you is precious.
      
      On your special day, I want you to feel as loved and cherished as you truly are. You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I promise to do everything I can to make sure you always feel it. May all your dreams come true, and may this year bring you endless love, success, and unforgettable moments.
      
      No matter what, I’ll always be here, loving you more with each passing day. Let’s make today as beautiful as you are.</p>
      <p>Happy birthday, my Bebo! ❤</p>
